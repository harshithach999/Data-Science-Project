## Overview
This project focuses on detecting AI-generated text using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The primary aim is to build a robust prediction model that can accurately classify and detect AI-generated text, which is crucial in maintaining the integrity of information. The project utilizes ensemble models combining Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to achieve a high precision score in identifying text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) versus human-written text. The model demonstrated a precision score of 97% and runs efficiently, making it a valuable tool for real-time applications.

## Results
This section presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance results of various machine learning and deep learning models used in the project. Each model was evaluated based on precision and runtime. For deep learning models, additional metrics such as the loss curve were analyzed to understand their behavior over time. Below are the summarized results:

### Machine Learning Models
| Model               | Precision | Runtime (CPU based) |
|---------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Logistic Regression | 95%       | 1.72 sec            |
| Support Vector Machine | 95%   | 15.79 sec           |
| XGBoost             | 96%       | 113.47 sec          |
| Voting Classifier   | 97%       | 0.35 sec            |

The voting classifier, combining Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost, achieved the highest precision and the quickest runtime, making it the most efficient model for this task.

### Deep Learning Models
| Model   | Precision | Runtime (GPU based) |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| BERT    | 97%       | 149.87 sec           |
| RoBERTa | 99%       | 218.39 sec           |
| MLP     | 83%       | 6.72 sec             |

While RoBERTa achieved the highest precision, it required the longest runtime. BERT balanced high precision with a more moderate runtime compared to RoBERTa. The MLP model, although quicker, had a lower precision.
